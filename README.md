# FoxBox2D

*An attempt at creating a robust, efficient collision & physics **test** engine to be incorporated into all future projects*
Utilizes the Digipen proprietary CProcessing engine for graphical displays, hideously ported over from C to C++

This was made for the sole purpose of learning and grasping the various concepts around physics, collision detection & resolution, and as such the code will be messy and badly written and a disgrace to programmers worldwide. I make no apologies for those who wish to take this code and learn from it but can't due to the way it was written.

## Current Features
- Convex polygon generation
- Reduced GJK collision detection
- Basic EPA to generate collision normals for resolution
- Static collision resolution
- Display & basic interactions of colliders

## Future Features
- Full GJK collision detection
- Optimised collision detection (AABB, spheres)
- Swept-Collider GJK collision detection
- Incorporation of MPR into GJK algorithms
- Basic physics (Velocity, acceleration, gravity etc.)
- Rotational physics (Rigidbody physics)
- Foxes?
- ...etc.
